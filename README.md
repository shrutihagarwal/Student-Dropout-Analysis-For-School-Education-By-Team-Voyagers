## 1. Overview
Education is universally recognized as a fundamental human right and a potent catalyst for social mobility and overall progress of a country. Education is key to creating a level playing field. The dropout rate is a metric that quantifies the percentage of students who discontinue their education before completing a particular level or grade. It serves as a crucial gauge of the education system's effectiveness. 

### 1.1 Background 
Various social and economic factors lead to students dropping out of schools. There has been a significant decrease in dropout rate in primary level but a lot more work needs to be done at secondary and senior secondary level. Identification of major challenges faced by students can help in formulation of targeted interventions that can reduce drop out rate.

### 1.2 Objectives and scope
Analysis of student dropout rate at  school level based on following categories:
- Gender
- Area  
- Age/standard
- Social Category 
Understanding overall trends of drop out rate at various levels. Identification of factors that lead to students dropping out from schools. The aim is to help in developing data driven policies for reduction of student drop out rate.

### 1.3 Importance of Addressing School Dropout rates.
Drop rate is an important indicator of educational success and can vary significantly by region, country, and socioeconomic factors. It indicates that a significant proportion of students are not completing their education, which can have long-term consequences on their future opportunities and economic prospects. Students who drop out struggle to find better employment. They face higher risk of child marriage and getting into illegal activities.
Thus, it is very important to ensure that more and more students complete their education. According to National Education Policy 2020, the government aims to decrease the dropout rate to zero and to ensure that the gross enrollment ratio in higher secondary schools is 100%.
